# Introduction

This document illustrates the use of sRACIPE to simulate any 
circuit or network or topology (used interchangeably) 
and analyze the generated data. 
For simplicity, we will start with the toggle switch with mutual inhibition and 
self activation of both genes as a test case.

# Load the Circuit
As a first step, set the directory to the desired folder where you want to 
keep the input topology file and the results. In the working directory 
("man" in this example), create a folder "inputs" and place the 
topology (network or circuit) file in that folder or
load the topology as a dataframe. 
The typical format of the topology 
file is a 3 column file where the first column is name of the source gene, 
second column is name of the target gene and last column is 
the interaction type (1 - activation, 2-inhibition). 
The first line should contain the header (Source Target Interaction). 
We will work with the a demo circuit from the package.

```{r eval=TRUE}
library(sRACIPE)

# Load a demo circuit
data("demoCircuit")
demoCircuit

```

# Simulate the circuit
To simulate the demo circuit, we will first save it to inputs folder and use the
new file as the input to simulateGRC function. We will use a reduced number of 
models (using numModels) for demonstration. The simulations will return a 
RacipeSE object. 


```{r}

rSet <- sRACIPE::simulateGRC(circuit = demoCircuit, numModels = 10,
                             plots = FALSE)

```

# Plotting the simulated data

We can plot the simulated data using the plotData function or using plots=TRUE
in simulateGRC. The data will be normalized before plotting. By default, two 
clusters are identified and models colored according to hierarchical clustering.

```{r eval=TRUE}
rSet <- sRACIPE::plotData(rSet, plotToFile = FALSE)

```

# Knockdown Analysis
The simulations can be used to perform in-silico perturbation analysis. 
For example, here we will limit a gene's production rate to mimic its knockdown
and show how that changes the relative proportion of models in different 
clusters.

```{r eval=FALSE}
data("demoCircuit")
rSet <- sRACIPE::simulateGRC(circuit = demoCircuit, 
                             numModels = 100, plots = FALSE)
kd <- sRACIPE::knockDownAnalysis(rSet, plotToFile = FALSE)
```

# Plot the network 

The network can be plotted in an interactive viewer 
or html file in the results  folder.

```{r eval=FALSE}
 sRACIPE::plotCircuit(rSet, plotToFile = FALSE)
```


#  Stochastic simulations 

One can perform stochastic simulations similarly by specifying additional 
parameters to the simulateGRC function, namely, nNoise (the number of noise
levels at which the stochastic simulations should be carried out), initialNoise 
(the starting noise level) and noiseScalingFactor (the multiplicative factor by
which noise should be reduced for multiple noise levels). 
For annealing, use anneal=TRUE alongwith the above mentioned parameters.
For simulations at one
noise level only, use nNoise = 1 and set initialNoise parameter to the specific 
noise. 

Now the returned list will contain an additional element named 
stochasticSimulations which is a list of dataframes. Each dataframe contains the
simulations for one noise level (the name of the dataframe).

```{r eval=TRUE}
rSet <- sRACIPE::simulateGRC(circuit = demoCircuit, numModels = 50, 
                             initialNoise = 15, noiseScalingFactor = 0.1,
                             nNoise = 2,
                             plots = FALSE, plotToFile = FALSE)

```

Here, calling the simulateGRC function simulated the circuit at zero noise level
as well as the two (nNoise) other noise levels 15 (initialNoise), 1.5 
(initialNoise*noiseScalingFactor). The first three plots (hierarchical 
clustering heatmap, Umap, PCA) correspond to deterministic data and the last
two plots contain the data from stochastic simulations projected on the 
principal components of the deterministic simulations.

Note that the rSet now contains stochasticSimulations as well as 
additional elements like umap, pca, assignedClusters. These are 
added when the data is plotted. As mentioned previously, 
the stochasticSimulations 
contains two dataframes named "15" and "1.5" which correspond to noise levels. 


For annealing simulations, one can set anneal=TRUE in the simulateGRC function.
With anneal=FALSE (constant noise), simulations at different noise levels are 
independent of each other. These are useful if one is primarily interested in 
the gene expressions at different noise levels and at zero noise 
(used for normalizing the data). With annealing, the steady state solutions
at higher noise levels are used as the intial conditions for lower noise levels 
such that each model converges to its most stable state when the noise is zero.


Using annealing, ideally the number of noise levels should be very large 
and noiseScalingFactor close to 1 as we want to reduce the noise very slowly. 
In practice, we found nNoise ~ 30 and 
initialNoise ~50 divided by sqrt(number_gene) 
as good starting values. Constant noise and annealing noise simulations pca 
plots can be used for better approximations of these parameters. 
The initialNoise should be such that there is a single cluster at this 
high noise level (essentially the gene expression values are random and circuit 
topology has little effect). Next, noiseScalingFactor  should be adjusted such 
that there are sufficient noise levels when this single cluster splits into 
multiple clusters observed in deterministic simulations. 

With annealing,
the models converge to their most stable steady state 
at zero noise. Thus, the number of models is more stable clusters
will increase and number in less 
stable clusters will decrease. Note that for non zero noise, the stable states
can be different from the stable states at zero noise. In our illustrative 
example shown abpve, the previous two stable states of a toggle circuit are no 
longer stable at high noise ("15") and instead the previously unstable high high
state is stable now. Briefly, noise can change the stable states and zero noise
simulations using annealing can  
gives us an idea about the relative stability of states 
when there are multiple stable states. 

Further, one can modify the parameters and/or initial conditions
and simulate the circuit with
modified parameters and/or initial conditions using the parameters 
genParams = FALSE and/or genIC = FALSE. 


```{r eval=TRUE}
rSet <- sRACIPE::simulateGRC(circuit = demoCircuit, numModels = 10, 
                             plots = FALSE)
params <- params(rSet)
modifiedParams <- as.matrix(params) 
modifiedParams[,1] <- 0.1*modifiedParams[,1]
params(rSet) <- DataFrame(modifiedParams)
rSet <- sRACIPE::simulateGRC(rSet, plots = FALSE, genParams = FALSE)

```


# KnockOut Simulations

Knockout of a gene is implemented by changing the production rate and initial 
condition of the gene to zero. The knockOut parameter in the function 
simulateGRC can be used to perform these knockout simulations. If simulations 
are to be carried out for knockouts of different genes, the genes should be 
specified as a list where each list element will contain the names of the gene 
to be knocked out. For example, knockout = list("gene1", "gene2", 
c("gene3", "gene4"), "gene5") will knockout gene1, gene2, gene5 one by one
and knockout gene3 and gene4 simultaneously.
knockOut = "all", each gene is knocked out one by one and the results are 
returned as an element knockOutSimulations which, similar to 
stochasticSimulations, is a list of dataframes containing the gene expressions
obtained by knockout one or more genes. Enabling plots=TRUE will plot the 
results. As the expression of knockout gene is zero, we compute PCA with 
unperturbed genes for both the unperturbed simulations as well as the
perturbed simulations. So for each knockout, we have two plots containing the
scatter plot of unperturbed simulations and perturbed simulations on the PCs of
unperturbed simulations (excluding the gene to be perturbed).
